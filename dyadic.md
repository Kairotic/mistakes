# Dyadic arithmetic in the book of elements

Now discrete mathematics is thought about in the technological context
of modern computers, and we struggle to understand the connection with
weaving. However, if we look back, we realise that the birth of
discrete mathematics took place when weaving was the predominant
technology. The hypothesis of Kl√ºck (TODO: cross ref Ellen's article),
which lies at the core of the present special issue, is that discrete
mathematics began with thought processes of weavers, and that this is
implicit in the system of counting defined in Euclid's Book of Elements
(book VII).  To engage with this hypothesis, we attempted to implement
this system of counting in a contemporary programming language.
