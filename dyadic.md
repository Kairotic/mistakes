Now discrete mathematics is thought about in the technological context
of modern computers, and we struggle to understand the connection with
weaving. However, if we look back, we realise that the birth of
discrete mathematics took place when weaving was the predominant
technology. The hypothesis of Kl√ºck (TODO: cross ref Ellen's article),
which lies at the core of the present special issue, is that discrete
mathematics began with thought processes of weavers, and that this is
implicit in the system of counting defined and applied in Euclid's
Elements.  To engage with this hypothesis, we attempted to implement
this system of counting in a contemporary programming language.

We will make this attempt using the Haskell programming language,
known for its very strong focus on defining the types of things in
clear way. We will approach the definitions given in book VII in turn,
in the following, to see how far we can get, and what problems arise.

## Definition 1: A unit is that by virtue of which each of the things
that exist is called one.

~~~~{.haskell .colourtex}
data Unit = Unit
~~~~

The first definition appears straightforward, but allows us to
introduce our first piece of Haskell code, which simply defines a
*data type*. On the left is given the name of the data type, in this
case `Unit`, and on the right all the possible instances of that type,
which here is again called `Unit`.

However, the above already has an error, in that in ancient Greece, a
unit would not be thought of as abstract in this way; you could think
about a sheep unit, or a cow unit, but ancient Greeks would find it
nonsensical to think of a unit as being independent of such a
category. Haskell allows us to model this as this by adding a
parameter `a` for the type:

~~~~{.haskell .colourtex}
data Unit a = forall a. (Unit a)
~~~~

As the `forall` suggests, the type `a` can represent any other type
that we might define, such as `Sheep` or `Cow`. In practice this type
parameter does nothing, apart from indicate that a `Unit` is thought
about with reference to a concrete type of thing. So to model an unit
of Sheep, we could do the following:

~~~~{.haskell .colourtex}
data Sheep = Sheep {colour :: String}

sheep = Unit (Sheep "white")
~~~~

However we are not interested in `Unit`s having a particular identity
here, so we will use a definition which specifies a type parameter,
but does not require a value when a Unit is being instantiated:

~~~~{.haskell .colourtex}
data Unit a = forall a. Unit

sheep :: Unit Sheep
sheep = Unit
~~~~

Our sheep here still has the type of `Unit Sheep`, but does not define
anything about a particular sheep.

## Definition 2: A number is a multitude composed of units.

The second definition again appears straightforward; in code terms we
can think of a multitude as a list, which is denoted by putting the
`Unit` datatype in brackets:

~~~~{.haskell .colourtex}
type Multitude a = [Unit a]
~~~~

Note that the same type parameter is used in `Unit a` and `Multitude a`, which means that you for example can't mix `Sheep` and `Cow`s in the same multitude.

However again, the detail makes this a little bit complex. Firstly,
such a list is allowed to be empty, whereas the number zero is not
represented by this definition. Indeed, neither is the number one -- a
multitude begins with two, less than that is not considered to be a
number.

A way around this is to define the basis of a multitude as a pair, and
model greater numbers with additional units relative to that:

~~~~{.haskell .colourtex}
data Multitude a = Pair (Unit a) (Unit a)
    | AddUnit (Unit a) (Multitude a)
~~~~

The number four would then be constructed with the following:

~~~~{.haskell .colourtex}
four = AddUnit Unit (AddUnit Unit (Pair Unit Unit))
~~~~

We can visualise the number four by telling Haskell to show a `Unit`
with an `x` and by stringing together the units across instances of
`Pair` and `AddUnit`:

instance Show (Unit a) where
  show x = "x"

instance Show (Multitude a) where
  show (Pair u u') = show u ++ show u'
  show (AddUnit u n) = show u ++ show n
