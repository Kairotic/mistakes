% Textility of Code: A catalogue of errors

# Introduction

<> (removed - this seems beside the point.. could go in intro of the journal issue instead. In the following we explore the notion of code as weave. A challenge for any discussion of coding of weaves is the Jacquard mechanism in machine looms, often recounted as the first meeting point of digital technology and weaving. This is wrong for many reasons, but most crucially, weaving involves the interaction of discrete threads and so has itself always been digital technology since prehistoric times. Furthermore, code involves human enagement with structure, whereas the Jacquard mechanism allows weaves to be considered as two dimensional images, rather than the three dimensional structures which give rise to them.)

Through the following article, we look for different ways to represent
the structure of ancient weaves with contemporary source code.
